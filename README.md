# **Mirror Game**
Welcome to the Black Box Mirror Game!

In this game, there are mirrors randomly set up in a black box. The aim is to find each of the mirrors by either:

    1. Shooting lasers into the grid and observing where they exit, or

    2. Guessing the mirror positions directly.

The program keeps track of guesses, laser shots, and mirrors found. A hidden “cheat code” option will reveal all mirror positions.

As of now, this program does not have a display. I hope to add one during the summer.
